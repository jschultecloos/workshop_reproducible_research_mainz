# Introduction

This is the first sentence in my reproducible document.^[This is only a footnote.] Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Proin pellentesque lacus at lorem blandit cursus. Etiam semper, lectus vitae aliquet aliquet, tellus mauris ullamcorper massa, vel laoreet felis orci quis nibh. Lorem Ipsum is not just random text, contrary to common assumption. It is more than 2000 years old and has origins in a work of classical Latin literature from 45 BC. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of Cicero’s “de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum” (The Extremes of Good and Evil) are where Lorem Ipsum is found. The philosophy of ethics, which was extremely prominent throughout the Renaissance, is the subject of this book. Lorem Ipsum’s opening phrase, “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,” is taken from a Latin phrase.

# Results

```{r}
#| label: estimate-regression-models
#| tbl-pos: 'tb'



url <- 'https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/Stat2Data/Pulse.csv'
pulse_data <- read_csv(url) %>%
  select(-c(1))


models <- list(
  "M1" = lm(Rest ~ Smoke + Exercise + Wgt + Sex,
            data = pulse_data),
  "M2" = lm(Rest ~ Smoke*Exercise + Wgt + Sex,
            data = pulse_data),
  "M3" = lm(Active ~ Smoke + Exercise + Wgt + Sex,
            data = pulse_data),
  "M4" = lm(Active ~ Smoke*Exercise + Wgt + Sex,
            data = pulse_data)
)

```

Next, we turn to a more contemporary phenomenon. How do exercising and smoking habits affect the pulse rates of students? The data presented below comes from the [Stat2Data](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/Stat2Data/Pulse.csv) package. We use `modelsummary` [@Arel-Bundock.2020] to present the results in a table. This package is a very powerful to present regression tables in several different output formats. Depending on our preferred table styling package, we can chose among different output formats and then further style the regression table according to our personal needs. In the example below, we use `kableExtra` to style the table.




```{r}
#| label: tbl-regression
#| tbl-cap: "Resting and active pulse rates as a function of sex, weight, exercise, and smoking habits among students"

# report only basic goodness-of-fit statistics
round_function <- function(x) format(round(x, 3))
gm <- list(
  list("raw" = "r.squared", "clean" = "R$^2$", "fmt" = round_function),
  list("raw" = "nobs", "clean" = "Num.Obs.", "fmt" = round_function)
  )

reg_table <- modelsummary(
  models,
  stars = TRUE,
  # report only basic goodness-of-fit stats
  gof_map = gm, 
  escape = FALSE
  )

reg_table %>%
  # column labels
  add_header_above(c(" " = 1,
                     "Resting Pulse" = 2,
                     "Active Pulse" = 2)) %>%
  # footnote
  add_footnote("Dataset: 'Pulse Rates and Exercise' from the Stat2Data package.",
               notation = "none"
  ) 

```

Students who smoke, on average, have a `r tidy(models$M1) %>% dplyr::filter(term == "Smoke") %>% pull(estimate) %>% round(., digits=3)` higher resting pulse than students who do not smoke (see @tbl-regression).


# Side-by-side tables

We can also include two tables side-by-side. They can have an overall caption and a subcaption. 


```{r}
#| label: tbl-side-by-side-regression
#| tbl-cap: "Pulse rates as a function of sex, weight, exercise, and smoking habits among students"
#| tbl-subcap: 
#|   - "Resting Pulse"
#|   - "Active Pulse"
#| layout-ncol: 2


models_resting <- list(
  "M1" = lm(Rest ~ Smoke + Exercise + Wgt + Sex,
            data = pulse_data),
  "M2" = lm(Rest ~ Smoke*Exercise + Wgt + Sex,
            data = pulse_data)
)

models_active <- list(
  "M3" = lm(Active ~ Smoke + Exercise + Wgt + Sex,
            data = pulse_data),
  "M4" = lm(Active ~ Smoke*Exercise + Wgt + Sex,
            data = pulse_data)
)


modelsummary(
  models_resting,
  stars = TRUE,
  # report only basic goodness-of-fit stats
  gof_map = gm, 
  escape = FALSE
  )

modelsummary(
  models_active, 
  stars = TRUE,
  # report only basic goodness-of-fit stats
  gof_map = gm, 
  escape = FALSE
  )

```
