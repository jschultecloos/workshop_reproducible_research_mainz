# Reproducible Reports with Quarto

This repository contains the workshop materials for the short workshop **"Reproducible Reports with Quarto"** taught by Dr. Julia Schulte-Cloos at the Department of Political Science at the University of Mainz.

## Before the course starts :rocket: 

1. Install Docker (https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
2. Create a directory to store the workshop materials
3. Download the Dockerfile and save it into the directory you created for the workshop
4. Open a command line interface of your choice in this directory (Windows users can use Powershell, Mac users the integrated terminal, Linux users know which terminal they want to use anyway)
5. Type "docker build --tag workshop_quarto:latest ." and hit enter
6. Sit back, and wait until the docker image has been built (it may take some time, depending on your internet connection)
7. Great job! You are done and ready for the workshop ðŸ™‚
